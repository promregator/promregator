/**
 * Interface to derive username and password used for accessing the CF API 
 * programmatically.
 * 
 * A Promregator extension may implement this interface to provide username and password
 * each time Promregator requires the credentials for authenticating towards
 * the associated Cloud Foundry API server.
 * The derivation may happen dynamically (i.e. the credentials may change over
 * time).
 * It is considered an implementation detail of the extension how the 
 * credentials are being determined, e.g. read from a vault or generated
 * based on a certain schema / private key.
 * 
 * To make Promregator use your implementation do the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ensure that neither the configuration parameters <code>cf.username</code>
 * nor <code>cf.password</code> are set.</li>
 * <li>Register a new Spring Bean which returns an instance of type
 * CFApiCredentials</li>
 * </ul>
